The announcement originated from AS174 (Cogent Communications) and propagated through AS33154 (DQE Communications) before reaching AS3320. While the origin AS (3320) matches the legitimate owner, the path suggests a direct connection between AS33154 and AS3320 that does not exist in reality. This incident represents a path forgery attack where AS33154 falsely claims adjacency to AS3320 to intercept or manipulate traffic.\n【分析逻辑】: Step 1: Verify the origin AS. The detected origin is AS3320, which matches the expected origin (Deutsche Telekom), indicating the prefix ownership is correct. This rules out a direct hijack. Step 2: Examine the AS_PATH for adjacency validity. The path '174 33154 3320' shows AS33154 as the second-to-last AS and AS3320 as the last AS, implying a direct link. Step 3: Check real-world AS relationships. Deutsche Telekom (AS3320) is a large Tier 1 ISP with no legitimate upstream or peer connection to DQE Communications (AS33154), a smaller regional provider. Step 4: Identify the fake adjacency. Since AS33154 is not a legitimate neighbor of AS3320, the link between them is fabricated. Step 5: Determine the attacker. In path forgery attacks, the attacker is the AS that announces the fake link, which is AS33154 (the second-to-last AS in the path).\n【结论】: {\n  \"status\": \"MALICIOUS\",\n  \"attacker_as\": \"33154\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\"\n}\n\n\n--- [参考案例 #2 | 相关性: 0.49] ---\n【类型】: Direct Hijack\n【场景】: A BGP monitoring system detects an anomalous route announcement for Deutsche Telekom's prefix 194.25.0.0/16. The route is being propagated with AS_PATH '3356 4134', indicating Level 3 (AS3356) as the upstream provider and China Telecom (AS4134) as the origin. This is suspicious because Deutsche Telekom (AS3320) is the legitimate owner of this prefix, and there is no legitimate business relationship that would justify China Telecom originating this route. The announcement appears globally, suggesting a deliberate hijack attempt to intercept traffic destined for Deutsche Telekom's network.\n【分析逻辑】: Step 1: Extract the origin AS from the AS_PATH. In BGP, the origin is the last AS in the AS_PATH, which is AS4134 (China Telecom). Step 2: Compare the detected origin (AS4134) with the expected origin from the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) or RPKI records, which is AS3320 (Deutsche Telekom). Step 3: Since AS4134 does not match AS3320, this indicates an unauthorized origin change. Step 4: Verify that AS4134 is not a legitimate downstream or customer of AS3320 for this prefix (it is not, based on known business relationships). Step 5: Conclude that AS4134 is the attacker, as it has placed itself at the origin position without authorization, directly hijacking the prefix.\n【结论】: {\n  \"status\": \"MALICIOUS\",\n  \"attacker_as\": \"4134\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\"\n}\n",
